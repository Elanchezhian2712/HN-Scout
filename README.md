## Design & Implementation Choices

### UI/UX

The UI is clean, information-dense, and mobile-first. A dark theme reduces eye strain, while a clear visual hierarchy guides the user. Next.js App Router features like `loading.tsx` and `error.tsx` are used for seamless, non-jarring state transitions.

### Algorithm: The Quality Score

The formula balances popularity with freshness to ensure engaging content surfaces effectively.

**Formula:** `Score = (Points + Comments * 2) / (HoursAgo + 2)^1.8`

-   **Prominence:** Weights comments heavily to reward engaging discussion.
-   **Time Decay:** Penalizes older posts to keep content fresh, with a 2-hour grace period for new stories.
-   **Per-Page Re-ranking:** This pragmatic, API-friendly choice avoids the performance cost of a global ranking system while providing immediate value on each page.

### AI Tools Used

AI tools like GitHub Copilot and Google AI Studio accelerated development by assisting with boilerplate code, utility functions, and initial Tailwind CSS class generation.
